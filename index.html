      <h2>About</h2>
      <p id="page1">I am a proactive and disciplined individual striving to make my mark in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. I recently joined NPower to gain valuable hands-on experience.</p>
      <p>After graduating from Mount Zion Christian Academy in 2022, I started my path to a career in information technology by enrolling in Durham Technical Community College's Associate of Applied Science program in Software Development.</p>
      <p>I am dedicated to improving my coding skills and have a deep passion for helping others become knowledgeable in IT. My kind personality, persistent compassion, and willingness to lend a hand when needed are qualities I highly value. I strongly like the color yellow, which reflects my cheerful and optimistic character.</p>
      <p>In addition to his academic endeavors, Myles has a variety of interests that showcase his bright personality. He enjoys journaling, flying drones, playing video games, and spending time with his family. These activities not only help him relax but also significantly boost his creativity and strengthen his bond with his family.</p>
      <p>Myles is a genuinely remarkable person, well-known for his broad interests, compassionate nature, and unwavering commitment to his friends and peers. He is an incredible friend and a promising professional in the IT field.</p>
